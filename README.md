# NZ FLAGS! - GovHack NZ
This repository contains the code for the 2015 GovHack Project.

We did the web scraping of flag information from the government website using C\#.

The statistical analysis was done using R.

File pathes have been dashed (-----) to maintain anonymity.

NOTE: The executable for the main application has the following directory -

GovHack-master\Flag_App\WindowsFormsApplication1\bin\Debug\WindowsFormsApplication1.exe
